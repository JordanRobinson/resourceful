Resourceful
===========

Server application that emails out notifications when your Resource Guru schedule changes. Uses the Resource Guru API.

## Usage

`git clone`
`npm install`
`nodemon`

Create a config file with your details called `config.json` located in the root directory. The contents should look a bit like this:

`{
	"rgUsername":"j.robinson@building-blocks.com",
	"rgPassword":"hunter2",
	"mailUsername":"me@jordanrobinson.co.uk",
	"mailPassword":"hunter2"
}`

Then go to `http://localhost:33333`

## Contributing

There's a lot left to do. Even more I haven't thought of. Issue submissions and pull requests are definitely wanted.
